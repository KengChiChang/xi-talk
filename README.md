# xi-talk

Scraping important talks of Xi Jinping from this [online database](http://jhsjk.people.cn/article)
containing Xi Jinping's important talks since 2012. The database is maintained
by the Communist party's official news paper *People's Daily*.

It contains a total of 224 talks, dating from 2012-11-19 to 2017-09-27.
It also comes with eight pre-defined categories: economics, politics, culture,
society, ecology, party, defense, and diplomacy.

I still have not come up with some specific questions, though I do think
knowing more about this strong man is quite important. Please feel free to
discuss with me if you have some thoughts or comments.
